### Description

This repository contains code for the kaggle competition UBC Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification and Outlier Detection (UBC-OCEAN).

The `training` directory contains notebooks used for training models. The `submissions` contains notebooks that were used as submissions to the competition.

The submissions used for the final leaderboard score contain `FINAL` in the notebook name.

We used a tiled dataset and image tiling code [1] to train models. We trained models based on architectures laid out in several papers [2][3][4][5][6][7].
